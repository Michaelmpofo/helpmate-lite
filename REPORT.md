# Community Help Board - Design and Implementation Report

## 1. Chosen Domain & Task
The Community Help Board is a web application designed to connect people who need assistance with those willing to help. The platform facilitates community support across various categories including errands, tutoring, repairs, and tech support. The primary goal is to create a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to request and offer help within a community.

## 2. Design Approach
Our design follows User-Centered Design (UCD) principles with a focus on:
- **Accessibility**: Clear typography, proper contrast ratios, and responsive design
- **Simplicity**: Clean, minimalist interface with focused functionality
- **Feedback**: Immediate visual feedback for user actions through animations and toasts
- **Consistency**: Unified design language across all components
- **Efficiency**: Keyboard shortcuts and streamlined workflows

## 3. Key Features
- **Help Request Board**: Card-based layout showing requests with clear categorization
- **Real-time Chat**: Direct communication between helpers and requesters
- **Notification System**: Keep users informed about help offers and updates
- **Authentication Flow**: Secure and intuitive login/signup process
- **Theme Support**: Light/dark mode for different user preferences

## 4. Interactive Components (Norman's Model)
### Gulf of Execution
- **Intent to Action**: Clear call-to-action buttons ("New Request", "Offer Help")
- **Action Specification**: Form inputs with descriptive labels and placeholders
- **Action Execution**: Immediate feedback during form submission with loading states

### Gulf of Evaluation
- **System Response**: Toast notifications for success/error states
- **Response Interpretation**: Clear success messages and error explanations
- **Outcome Evaluation**: Visual updates to request status and notifications

## 5. Nielsen's Heuristics Application
